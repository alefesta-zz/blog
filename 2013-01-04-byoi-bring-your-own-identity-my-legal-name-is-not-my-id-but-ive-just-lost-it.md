_BYOI is a series I’ve decided to create to “talk” about #identitymanagement so it is about #security, #governance, #management and many other aspects of the #IAM realm._

My&#160; legal name is not my ID but seems I’ve just lost it and now I wonder if those ID’s I’m using still reflecting who am I and are still valid.

> Legal name is the name that an individual is given at birth and/or recognized by a government or other legal entity, or which appears on a birth certificate (see birth name), marriage certificate (in jurisdictions that permit or require a name change to be recorded at marriage), or other government issued document (e.g., court order) on which a legal name change is evidenced and recorded. 

wikipedia on “Legal Name”

What is your Legal Name? In Italy when I was born in 1972 it was used to assign to children a First Name followed by a Second and (eventually) a Third Name and finally the Surname. Traditionally this “form” was chosen this way: 

  * First Name = Chosen by parents
  * Second and Third Name = Grandparents names

In my case my parents went for the “masculine version” of my grandmothers names so at birth I was:

> <p align="left">
>   <em>Alessandro, Francesco, Emilio Festa</em>
> </p>

Please take note of the commas between the First,second and third name. The regulation at that time states that my Legal Name was composed by everything before the first comma plus the surname consequently my _Legal Name_ is:

> _Alessandro Festa_

My Identity is not my name but my name is part of my Identity? Many think that a name (Legal Name) do not have nothing with the physical Identity (**pID**) one have/develop but I am not agree.

You start to refer to yourself by your First Name or the Name your relative calls you when you are still a child and this is a first way to develop an identity:

> I am because my name is

I am not a sociologist and so please I am sure that my statement can lead to (almost) infinite discussion to this, this is just my opinion and feel free to comment it. Back to the post, as said to me when I was a child I start the fact that my parents call me “Alessandro”&#160; helped me to develop the bones of my _pID_ in a way similar to this:

_I am the one called this name and if my relatives call out that word it is referred to me only._ 

this, for a child, means that his name is:

  * **unique:** the combination parents voice + pronounced name could be only referred to a single “entity”
  * **certified:** it is the way I am called and I _trust_ my relatives enough to _assume_ there is no other name (or additional one)

What happen in the years is that at this very first skeleton of a complete identity the external influences and the discovery process make the _name_ less relevant. In few years you discover that your name:

  * **is not unique:** others share with you the same name and so even your relatives may, from time to time, refer to someone&#8217;s using “your” name
  * **is not certified:** the _Legal Name_&#160; could be different from the way your relatives refer to you

What you develop anyway is a more complex Identity made of many pieces like:

  * Sexual orientation
  * Religious/Political views
  * Music Influences
  * Work/Social influences

the sum of them make your _pID_&#160; that makes us_&#160; unique_.

> Digital identity is a psychological identity that prevails in the domains of cyberspace, and is defined as a set of data that uniquely describes a person or a thing (sometimes referred to as subject or entity) and contains information about the subject&#8217;s relationships to other entities. The social identity that an internet user establishes through digital identities in cyberspace is referred to as online identity.

Wikipedia on “Digital Identity”

So what make a digital identity (**dID**) different from a _pID_? I am sure many of the readers can affirm that there are many differences and exhibit many research to demonstrate that _dID_ and _pID_ are not the same thing.

An Identity is the sum of:

  * the way everybody refer to it
  * the uniqueness of it
  * the sum of the external/internal influences that helped to mold the identity

whether it is physical or digital an Identity still continue to be a sum of information&#8217;s that make it: recognizable and unique.

I’m avoiding to write about authentication systems and methods of identification because are not related to this post but again, with the obvious differences , if we refer in a simplistic way to the identification of an Identity we may find a sort of correspondence, in example:

> If I knock at the door of my parents house and they want to know who’s on the other side they simply go for a simple question like “who’s it?” and I’ll pronounce my name.

The name&#160; alone is not enough but the combination of: voice, timber, pronounce will convince my parents that I am who I said I am.

> An Identity is not secure or not but a simple set of “properties” to identify one entity.

What we just seen is then that a_&#160; Legal Name_ is for sure part of an Identity and can have the same importance/user of a_&#160; username_ in a _dID._

### The day I started to lose my name

So my _pID_ was quietly growing and being build by myself when around the age of 18th I was called to attend the mandatory “visita dei tre giorni”. Beside the, well know label in Italy (the 3 days visit), this was nothing more than a&#160; visit to be “certified” as “able to attend to the mandatory military service”.

As said nothing different from what an Italian male had to do around 1990 but what happened to me was that the day I was declared “able to join the military forces” my_&#160; Legal Name_ was printed out as:

> <p align="center">
>   <em>Alessandro France Festa</em>
> </p>

<p align="center">
  Please note the “France” part. What was happen was that some of the information systems of my city were upgraded to a new system (AS400) and consequently all the records were imported (manually).
</p>

  * <div align="left">
      First issue: they lost the first comma
    </div>

  * <div align="left">
      Second issue: the IS accept up to 16 characters
    </div>

<p align="left">
  My <em>pId</em>&#160; was<em>&#160; compromised?</em> If one of the parameter is the uniqueness&#160; so the answer I should say yes but since the the “issue” seemed limited to that special case it didn’t appear to have an impact to my life.
</p>

<p align="left">
  To make a long story short in the following years I requested and obtained:
</p>

  * <div align="left">
      <strong>a driving license: </strong>Alessandro Francesco Festa
    </div>

  * <div align="left">
      <strong>a tax code:</strong> Alessandro Festa
    </div>

  * <div align="left">
      <strong>an health card:</strong> Alessandro France
    </div>

  * <div align="left">
      <strong>various (updated) id cards:</strong> Alessandro France Festa
    </div>

  * <div align="left">
      <strong>credit and ATM cards:</strong> Alessandro Francesco Festa
    </div>

  * <div align="left">
      <strong>a passport:</strong> Alessandro Festa
    </div>

<p align="left">
  You’ll probably wonder why I didn’t to ask my name and fix the issue, well because the reply of my demographic office was always:
</p>

> <p align="left">
>   “no worries we are going to fix it automatically it’s just a question of time”
> </p>

<p align="left">
  What this story till now demonstrated to me that some of the “so-called” secure systems fail at the basics since do not double check the name of the requester. I have a passport that says “Alessandro” only an IDentity card that says “Alessandro Francesco” (in the mean time the<em>&#160; fixed</em> the problem as you may see).
</p>

<h3 align="left">
  My Identity is back
</h3>

<p align="left">
  So at the age of 40 my Identities converged in a<em>&#160; limbo</em> where I was able to demonstrate who I am almost always. The<em>&#160; workaround</em> was to accept the idea of my “wrong” name and when requested provide it to the requesting issuer of the service. So my <em>dID</em> like credit cards, ATM cards, electronic passports where created consequently and I accepted the idea to modify my signature in a way that reflect my “wrong” name.
</p>

<p align="left">
  So I had lost my name but reconciled my <em>dID</em> with my new <u><em>pID</em>.</u>

  Nothing is ever like appear (especially in Italy)

  I went through a divorce and did it all the papers needed by national regulation and at the very end it was requested by the judge to sign the final paper. The judge asked me to sing as First,Second and third Name plus Surname because that was what was written on the birth certificate and so I did.
</p>

<p align="left">
  What would happen if all of sudden a scrupulous employer of the demographic institute would notice the “issue” with your name and decide to call you to inform you that this situation is not<em>&#160; acceptable</em> and should be fixed “<em> as soon as possible”</em> ?
</p>

<p align="left">
  the option were:
</p>

  * <div align="left">
      Alessandro Francesco Festa : change of all documents to reconcile them with the new “entity”
    </div>

  * <div align="left">
      Alessandro Francesco Emilio Festa :change of all documents to reconcile them with the new “entity”
    </div>

  * <div align="left">
      Alessandro Festa:change of all documents to reconcile them with the new “entity”
    </div>

<p align="left">
  yes whether you look at it I was just informed that my<em>&#160; Legal Name</em> was lost and gone and….and wait let’s pretend for a moment&#160; that I have to demonstrate that my<em>&#160; pID</em> is the same of my <em>dID</em> for, let say, request a credit card to my bank because the other one I have is at EOL .Let’s pretend that the procedure is that I send a copy of my ID card to the bank? I do not have a name, my ID card is wrong because of the “<em>fixed issue above</em>” and consequently I am not able to identify my <em>pID.</em> Even worse my <em>dID</em> used, for example for online purchasing, is <em>technically</em>&#160; valid but<em>&#160; compromised</em> from the ability to reconcile that <em>dID</em>&#160; to my <em>pID</em>.
</p>

<p align="left">
  I am still living in the limbo waiting to produce all my new documents and cards and, hopefully, reconcile for the last name my <em>pID</em> with<em>&#160; myself</em>&#160; and<em> my dID’s</em>&#160; so if it happen to you to “meet” me in the cyberspace these days I cannot confirm it’s me and neither you because nobody of us know who I am at the moment.

**This&#160; story is absolutely true and happened to me recently.**
